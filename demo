In My bookings application : I have 4 components: 

Edit an existing Meeting

Book a new meeting

Check Room Availability

View Room calendars ( access only for admins ) - display rooms upon clicking that, booked host will be appeared in the calendar.



Now My task is to add or update some feature :

Add a new field in Roommodel to determine whether the particular room can be booked or not.
Admins panel

UI to display all the rooms and edit room details to allow or restrict people from booking it
Update get_all_rooms api or create a new api for handling the same


Give me ideas to do this. Give a simple idea that should work. Not more complicated.
